\section{Conclusion}

The encoder makes use of the arithmetic coder to reach decent compression ratios, with significant improvements over the initial RLE-Gb scheme. Because it tries all the possible schemes, it allows for the best available compression regardless of the image size.

To go one step further, it could have been possible to try an adaptive arithmetic encoder. The compression of the data would be less ideal than with the one that was implemented (that relies on the knowledge of the probability of each symbol) but would reduce the size of the necessary dictionary.
