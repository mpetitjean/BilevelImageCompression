# Image and Video Technology Exercices

Codes for the exercices of IVT by Mathieu Petitjean (mpetitje@ulb.ac.be).

## Run the codes

The codes require C++11 or later. In the folder of each exercise, a Makefile is provided. Type `make run` to compile and run the code. Beware that the Makefile relies on the fact that the machine has GCC installed.
